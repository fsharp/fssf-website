# fssf-website
New website for F# Software Foundation

Website is generated by [Fornax](https://github.com/ionide/Fornax).

Modifications are done by pull request, which are built automatically and the preview content is published to an [Azure Storage Account](https://fssfpreview.z22.web.core.windows.net) with any pull requests going to a subdirectory for the pull request number to help contributors test their changes.

## How to contribute

To contribute, first check the [projects](https://github.com/fsharp/fssf-website/projects/1) for static content to migrate. Move the note to "In progress", convert it to an issue, and assign it to yourself so others are aware you are working on it.

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Install the .NET Core 3 SDK.
3. Run `dotnet tool restore` - this will download the static site generator `fornax`.
4. Edit the website content locally. If using an editor such as VS Code with Ionide or Rider, you'll have syntax highlighting and typechecking as you author the content.
5. To build the site locally, use `dotnet tool run fornax build`.
6. To run the site on a local server, user `dotnet tool run fornax watch` and then browse to http://localhost:8080 to see the content.
7. When your works is ready to publish, commit the changes and create a pull request from your fork.

Once your work is merged, please close the issue. If the work is too large and you'd like to split it up, add an additional note card with the balance of work.

Thank you for your contributions, and please reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
